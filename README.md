# ScreenTinker

ScreenTinker is self-hosted digital signage software. Manage screens across multiple locations from one dashboard — built for retail, offices, lobbies, and any environment where you need centralized control over what's displayed on remote screens. Open source, multi-tenant, single-developer maintained with direct contact access.

**Hosted version:** [screentinker.com](https://screentinker.com) — free tier available, no credit card required.
**Community:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/JHWQRPaG)

## Features

- **Playlists** — first-class playlist objects: create, reorder, set per-item duration, share one playlist across multiple displays; draft/publish workflow with revert-to-published
- **Device groups** — organize displays into groups, assign a playlist to an entire group, send bulk commands (reboot, screen on/off, launch, update, shutdown), schedule content group-wide
- **Multi-zone layouts** — split screens into zones with drag-and-drop editor; 7 built-in templates (fullscreen, split, L-bar, PiP, grid)
- **Video walls** — combine multiple displays into one screen with bezel compensation, device rotation, and leader-based sync
- **Remote control** — live view, touch injection, key input, power on/off
- **Scheduling** — visual weekly calendar with recurrence rules (daily/weekly/monthly), priority-based conflict resolution, both device-level and group-level schedules (device-level overrides win over group-level), timezone support
- **Widgets** — clocks, weather, RSS tickers, text/HTML, webpages, social feeds, and Directory Board (scrolling lobby tenant/room/staff directories with dark/light themes, category management, and anti-burn-in motion)
- **Kiosk mode** — interactive touchscreen interfaces
- **Proof-of-play** — per-content and per-device analytics, hourly/daily breakdowns, CSV export for ad verification
- **Device telemetry** — battery, storage, RAM, CPU, WiFi signal strength, and uptime reported by Android players
- **Offline resilience** — both web and Android players keep displaying cached content during server or internet outages (Android ContentCache, web player Service Worker); state syncs when connectivity returns
- **Mobile-responsive** — full management dashboard and landing page work on phones and tablets
- **Workspaces** — multi-tenant data model: organizations contain workspaces, workspaces contain devices/content/playlists/schedules; users can be members of multiple workspaces and switch via a dropdown in the sidebar
- **Member roles** — six-level hierarchy (platform_admin / org_owner / org_admin / workspace_admin / workspace_editor / workspace_viewer) gated at every API route
- **Alerts** — email notifications via Microsoft Graph when devices go offline; built-in spam protection (2h dedup, 24h long-offline cutoff, sequential send pattern); per-user opt-out via Settings → Account
- **White-label** — custom branding, colors, logo, favicon, CSS, and domain
- **Content management** — folder organization, remote URL content (no upload needed), YouTube embeds, video duration detection via ffprobe, automatic thumbnail generation, Unicode-safe filenames (NFC normalization + UTF-8 multipart decoding)
- **Export/Import** — v2 format with playlists, device groups, schedules, and optional media bundling (ZIP); backward-compatible v1 import with automatic playlist migration
- **Device authentication** — per-device tokens for secure WebSocket connections; devices authenticate on every reconnect
- **Account management** — in-app password change, profile editing, email-based password reset
- **Security** — JWT auth, bcrypt hashing, parameterized SQL, rate-limited endpoints, per-user ownership checks on all resources, ongoing auth/IDOR/XSS audits
- **Built-in billing** — Stripe integration for SaaS subscriptions (optional)
- **Auto-update** — OTA updates pushed to devices automatically
- **Activity log** — full audit trail of user and system actions

## Architecture

### Multi-tenancy model

Three nested primitives:

```
organizations (billing + branding container)
   workspaces  (resource scope: devices, content, playlists, schedules, walls, layouts, widgets, groups)
      members (users with a role on that workspace)
```

Every resource (device, content row, playlist, schedule, etc.) carries a `workspace_id`. Every API route filters by it. Cross-workspace access requires switching workspaces via the sidebar dropdown — there are no magic role-based "see everything" bypasses on individual resource routes.

### Role hierarchy

Six roles, top wins:

| Role | Scope | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| `platform_admin` | every workspace in the system | full read/write (via acting-as on workspaces they're not a direct member of) |
| `org_owner` | one organization | billing + delete + admin within all workspaces in the org |
| `org_admin` | one organization | admin within all workspaces in the org (no billing) |
| `workspace_admin` | one workspace | manage members, rename, full read/write |
| `workspace_editor` | one workspace | create/edit content, devices, playlists, schedules; no member changes |
| `workspace_viewer` | one workspace | read-only |

### Workspace switcher

Users who are members of more than one workspace see a dropdown in the sidebar header. Switching mints a fresh JWT with the new `current_workspace_id` claim and reloads the page. Platform admins see every workspace in the system.

### Auto-migration on boot

Schema migrations run automatically the first time the server starts after a git pull. **Self-hosters never need to run a manual migration command.** On detecting a pre-multi-tenancy database, the server takes a timestamped snapshot (`server/db/remote_display.pre-migration-<timestamp>.db`), runs the Phase 1 migration (creates `organizations` / `workspaces` / `workspace_members` tables, backfills `workspace_id` on every resource, one auto-created Default workspace per existing user), then continues startup. If the migration fails the server prints the restore command and exits.

### Data flow

- **Android / web players** → device-namespace WebSocket → server. Authenticated per-device with a long-lived device token. Each device joins a room keyed on its `device_id`.
- **Admin dashboard** → dashboard-namespace WebSocket → server. Authenticated with the user's JWT. Each socket joins one room per accessible workspace so outbound events (device status, screenshots, playback progress) only reach dashboards that should see them.
- **Admin REST** → `/api/*` HTTPS → Express → SQLite. Everything scoped by `workspace_id` from JWT `current_workspace_id` claim.
- **Email** → Microsoft Graph `sendMail` via client-credentials OAuth flow. In-memory token cache. Sequential send pattern through alert backlogs to respect Graph's per-app concurrency limits.

## Supported Platforms

Android TV, Fire TV, Raspberry Pi, Windows, ChromeOS, LG webOS, Samsung Tizen, and any device with a web browser.

## Self-Hosting

### Requirements

- Node.js **20.6+** (the npm scripts use the built-in `--env-file-if-exists` flag, added in 20.6)
- Linux, macOS, or Windows
- SQLite (bundled via `better-sqlite3`; no separate install needed — `npm install` handles the native bindings)

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/screentinker/screentinker.git
cd screentinker/server
npm install
SELF_HOSTED=true npm start
```

The server starts on port 3001 (HTTP). If SSL certificates are present in `server/certs/`, it starts on port 3443 (HTTPS) with automatic HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect. Open the URL shown in the startup banner. The first registered user gets full access with all features unlocked.

Schema migrations run automatically on first boot — no manual migration commands at any point in the lifecycle.

`npm start` is preferred over `node server.js` directly because the script invokes Node with `--env-file-if-exists=.env` so a `server/.env` file (gitignored) is loaded automatically for local dev.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | HTTP port | `3001` |
| `HTTPS_PORT` | HTTPS port (used when SSL certs are present) | `3443` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime env (`production` enables Express production optimizations + stricter error handling) | _(none)_ |
| `SELF_HOSTED` | First user gets all features unlocked | `false` |
| `DISABLE_REGISTRATION` | Block new account creation (including OAuth auto-signup). First-user setup on an empty DB is still allowed. | `false` |
| `APP_URL` | Your public URL (used for Stripe callbacks) | _(none)_ |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing key (auto-generated if not set) | _(auto)_ |
| `SSL_CERT` | Path to SSL certificate | `server/certs/cert.pem` |
| `SSL_KEY` | Path to SSL private key | `server/certs/key.pem` |

### Optional Integrations

All integrations are optional. The app works fully without any of them.

#### Stripe (Billing)

If you want to charge your users, plug in your own Stripe keys. Without them, all features are free for all users.

1. Create a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com)
2. Create products/prices for each plan in the Stripe dashboard
3. Set up a webhook endpoint pointing to `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook` with these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
4. Update the `plans` table in the SQLite DB with your Stripe price IDs:
   ```sql
   UPDATE plans SET stripe_price_monthly = 'price_xxx', stripe_price_yearly = 'price_yyy' WHERE id = 'starter';
   ```
5. Set the environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Your Stripe secret key (`sk_live_...` or `sk_test_...`) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signing secret (`whsec_...`) |
| `APP_URL` | Your public URL (e.g. `https://signage.yourcompany.com`) |

The default plans are: Free (2 devices), Starter (8 devices), Pro (25 devices), and Enterprise (unlimited). Edit the `plans` table to change pricing, limits, or add/remove tiers. In self-hosted mode, the first user gets Enterprise automatically.

#### Google OAuth

Let users sign in with Google.

1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable the Google Identity API
3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (web application)
4. Add `https://yourdomain.com` as an authorized origin

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Google OAuth client ID |

#### Microsoft OAuth

Let users sign in with Microsoft/Azure AD.

1. Register an app in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps)
2. Add a web redirect URI: `https://yourdomain.com`
3. Note the Application (client) ID

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` | Your Azure AD application client ID |
| `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` | Tenant ID (`common` for multi-tenant) |

#### Email Alerts (Microsoft Graph)

Send email notifications when devices go offline. Backed by Microsoft Graph Mail.Send via the client-credentials flow.

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GRAPH_TENANT_ID` | Microsoft Azure AD tenant ID |
| `GRAPH_CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD app registration client ID |
| `GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET` | Azure AD app registration client secret |
| `GRAPH_SENDER_EMAIL` | Mailbox to send from (must be a valid mailbox or alias in the tenant) |
| `GRAPH_SENDER_NAME` | Display name shown in the email `From` field (defaults to `ScreenTinker`) |

**Azure AD app setup:**

1. Register a new app in Azure AD (single-tenant)
2. Under **API permissions**, add an **Application** permission: Microsoft Graph → `Mail.Send`
3. Click **Grant admin consent** for the tenant
4. Under **Certificates & secrets**, generate a new **Client secret** and capture the value (it is only shown once)
5. Capture the **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Application (client) ID** from the Overview page
6. Set the five env vars above in your deployment (systemd unit, `.env` file, etc.)

**Local dev fallback:** if any of `GRAPH_TENANT_ID`, `GRAPH_CLIENT_ID`, `GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET`, or `GRAPH_SENDER_EMAIL` is unset, `sendEmail()` short-circuits and logs `[EMAIL] not configured - would send to ...` to stdout instead of calling Graph. The app keeps running normally; only delivery is suppressed. This means a minimal local-dev install with no M365 access works fine — email-triggering features (device-offline alerts, future invite emails) just won't deliver anything externally.

**Dev safety allow-list:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GRAPH_DEV_RESTRICT_TO` | Comma-separated allow-list of recipient emails. When set, sends to addresses **not** in the list are suppressed (logged but never posted to Graph). |

Use this in local dev when running against a fresh production database clone to prevent accidental emails to real users. Leave it **unset in production** so emails flow to everyone normally.

**Alert spam protections** (also live, no configuration needed):
- **2-hour dedup window** per (alert-type, target-id) pair — the same device won't trigger repeated alerts within two hours
- **24-hour long-offline cutoff** — devices that have been offline for more than 24 hours stop generating alerts (the user already knows or the device is abandoned; further alerts are noise)
- **Sequential send pattern** through the offline-alert backlog — avoids Graph's per-app concurrent-send throttling (HTTP 429 `ApplicationThrottled`)
- **Per-user opt-out** via the `email_alerts` toggle in Settings → Account; respects user preference before any Graph call

### Production Deployment

For production, put the app behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.) with SSL:

```bash
# Create a dedicated user
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false screentinker

# Copy the app
sudo cp -r . /opt/screentinker
sudo chown -R screentinker:screentinker /opt/screentinker

# Install dependencies
cd /opt/screentinker/server && npm install --production

# Create a systemd service
sudo cat > /etc/systemd/system/screentinker.service << 'EOF'

    server_name signage.yourcompany.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;

        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400;
    }
}
```

### Updating

To update a running instance to the latest version:

```bash
cd /opt/screentinker

# Back up the database first
sqlite3 server/db/remote_display.db ".backup server/db/backup-$(date +%F).db"

# Pull latest code
git pull origin main

# Install any new dependencies
cd server && npm install --production

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart screentinker
```

If you deployed without git, you can initialize it:

```bash
cd /opt/screentinker
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/screentinker/screentinker.git
git fetch origin main
git checkout origin/main -- .
cd server && npm install --production
sudo systemctl restart screentinker
```

Your database, uploads, and configuration are preserved — only code files are updated.

**Schema migrations run automatically.** No manual migration commands at any point. On detecting a database that hasn't been through Phase 1 multi-tenancy migration yet, the server takes a timestamped snapshot first (`server/db/remote_display.pre-migration-<timestamp>.db`) and only continues startup once migration commits cleanly. If migration fails, the server logs the snapshot's path and exits — restore it with `cp` and investigate before retrying.

### Backups

The SQLite database is at `server/db/remote_display.db`. Back it up regularly:

```bash
# Safe backup (works even while the server is running)
sqlite3 server/db/remote_display.db ".backup /path/to/backup.db"
```

Uploaded content is in `server/uploads/`. Back that up too.

### Admin Recovery

Locked out? Run this on the server to get a temporary admin token (1 hour):

```bash
node scripts/reset-admin.js
```

### Building the Android APK

The Android player app is in the `android/` directory. To build it:

```bash
cd android

# Set your keystore credentials (or generate a new keystore)
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_password
export KEY_ALIAS=your_alias
export KEY_PASSWORD=your_password

# Build the APK
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Copy it to `server/` as `ScreenTinker.apk` to serve it from `/download/apk`:

```bash
cp android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk ScreenTinker.apk
```

To generate a new signing keystore:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias your_alias
```

**Requirements:** Java 17+, Android SDK (API 34).

### Device Setup

1. Register at your ScreenTinker instance
2. Go to **Displays** and click **Add Display**
3. Install the ScreenTinker app on your device:
   - **Android TV / tablets**: Download the APK from your instance (`/download/apk`) or build it from source (see above)
   - **Raspberry Pi**: `curl -sSL https://your-instance/scripts/raspberry-pi-setup.sh | bash`
   - **Windows**: Run the setup script from `scripts/windows-setup.bat`
   - **Any browser**: Open `https://your-instance/player` in kiosk/fullscreen mode
4. Enter the pairing code shown on the device

### For Developers

Working on ScreenTinker itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/screentinker/screentinker.git
cd screentinker/server
npm install
npm start          # starts in dev with --env-file-if-exists=.env
# or:
npm run dev        # same as start, plus --watch for auto-restart
```

**`.env` file (gitignored):** create `server/.env` for local configuration. Anything documented in the env var tables above works. Common starting set:

```
SELF_HOSTED=true
APP_URL=https://localhost:3443
# Optional: Microsoft Graph email config for testing real delivery
# GRAPH_TENANT_ID=...
# GRAPH_CLIENT_ID=...
# GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
# GRAPH_SENDER_EMAIL=you@yourcompany.com
# Optional: dev safety - only let these recipient emails through to Graph
# GRAPH_DEV_RESTRICT_TO=you@yourcompany.com,colleague@yourcompany.com
```

**No M365 access?** That's fine. With `GRAPH_*` env vars unset, `sendEmail()` short-circuits and logs `[EMAIL] not configured - would send to ...` to stdout. Everything else runs normally; only outbound email is suppressed. Useful for backend work that touches the email path without setting up an Azure app.

**Running against a fresh prod DB clone?** Set `GRAPH_DEV_RESTRICT_TO=your-email@example.com` to keep accidental sends from reaching real users in the cloned database. Sends to anyone outside the list are logged but never posted to Graph.

**Reporting issues:** [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/screentinker/screentinker/issues) for bugs and feature requests, or drop into [Discord](https://discord.gg/JHWQRPaG) for quick questions and feedback.

**Contributions welcome.** Fork → branch → PR. There are no formal style guides yet beyond what you can pick up from reading the existing code. Tests aren't required but smoke-test against your local server before opening a PR.
